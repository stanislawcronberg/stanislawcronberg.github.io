                This post is mostly written for myself.

                I expect most posts here will be for myself.  
                It's not that I don't care about other people, but I don't want to
                cater to some imaginary reader persona.
                If I did, I think that nothing I produced would be worth reading.

                My goal here is to just explore writing and let it happen one post at a time.

                I've thought a long time about starting to share my thoughts but somehow never got around to it.
                I honestly don't even have a good reason for wanting to write. It just appeared out of
                nowhere. It's always been difficult for me to figure out what I want to pursue in any given moment.
                Maybe part of me hopes that writing will help me better understand myself.
