                This post is mostly written for myself.

                All posts here will be for myself. But the hope is that some of them will 
                be useful to others. It's not that I don't care about other people, it's just 
                that this is an experiment. Sharing my thoughts openly online and seeing how it affects me.

                I cringe at the thought of posting to X or LinkedIn. I cringe even more at
                making any sort of content on YouTube or Instagram. It's not that I have anything
                against people who make content there, it's more that I would like to avoid 
                being more on social media than absolutely necessary.
            </p>

            <p>
                Which is why I settled on starting a blog. It's simple, and I don't have to rely on any service

                I never enjoyed writing in school. I have never been very
                good at it either, which may have something to do with my dislike.
            </p>

            <p>
                But there is something appealing in writing for it's own sake.
