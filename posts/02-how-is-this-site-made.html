            <p>
                As of writing this post, this website is written using pure HTML and CSS.
            </p>

            <p>
                While I am able to hack together a website in React with Vite and deploy it,
                it felt unnecessary. This is a static website, interactivity might detract
                from the user experience, and for now I can't be bothered to optimize every aspect. 
                Vanilla HTML and CSS just works. I'm always tempted to use the cutting-edge tech-stack
                in order to build the next project, but I find myself spending more time on
                learning the tools, and in turn building slower.
            </p>

            <p>
                It's worth mentioning that I don't come from a web-development background.
