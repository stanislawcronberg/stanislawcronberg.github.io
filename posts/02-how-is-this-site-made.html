                As of writing this post, this website is written using pure HTML and CSS.

                While I am able to hack together a modern website with React and deploy it,
                it felt unnecessary. This is a static website, no newsletter, and no comments section. 
                Vanilla HTML and CSS just works.
            </p>

                I'm always tempted to use the cutting-edge tech-stack
                in order to build the next project, but I find myself spending more time on
                learning the tools, and in turn producing less.

                It's not to say that I don't enjoy learning new things, but there are just way
                too many layers of abstraction in modern web-development that slow me down.
            </p>

            <p>
                It's worth mentioning that I don't come from a web-development background. 
                I work with building Machine Learning models and writing a lot of Python code.
                Say what you want, but Python is pretty great and easy to read. I'm sure I would
                get used to Typescript, but I just don't have time for everything.

                One of my all-time favorite books is <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30231806-goodbye-things">Goodbye, things</a> by Fumio Sasaki.
                It's about Japanese minimalism and Fumio's rather ascetic approach to it.
                Almost biographic, it describes the effect that decluttering had on him.
                The writing is extremely straightforward, free from fluff, and brutally honest.
                But the reason I'm mentioning him here is because I think much of development can be 
                approached with this minimalist mindset.

                When building out this site initially, I found myself adding a navbar header with a home, blog and about section.
                While I'm at it, let's add a footer, but let's make sure it sticks to the bottom of the page if there isn't
                that much content in the body. Now I need to include the navbar on top of each of the blog posts and in my CSS file
                highlight the currently active section. And suddenly with each choice made, there were even more appearing, each with
                their tradeoffs.
            </p>

            <p>
                I deleted it all.
            </p>

            <p>
                No navbar, no about section, no footer or items that weren't absolutely necessary. Just a single page. 
                An introduction with some social media links and below that a section with blog posts.
                As long as I don't have 100+ blog posts written, this is fine. 
            </p>

                The motivation behind this approach isn't to make the life of the reader miserable.
                I think it makes their experience more pleasant. They don't have to exert any effort
                trying to figure out what information they can find where. It's just there. I don't need an about
                section if I can just write a short 2 sentences on top of the home page. I don't need a separate page 
                for blog posts if there are only a handful. The email and linkedin icons make it easy to find me or reach out.
